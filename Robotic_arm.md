## Introduction

This project focuses on developing the firmware and control application for a **robotic arm**. The robotic arm is already mechanically functional, and this project will enable users to program and control it for a variety of tasks. The goal is to create an adaptable software ecosystem that can be applied to robotic arms of different sizes and configurations, providing users with an intuitive and powerful toolset.

The software will feature multiple programming interfaces: block-based programming for beginners, text-based coding for advanced users, and manual control using a controller. Additionally, the robotic arm will be fully simulated within the application, enabling users to program and preview tasks without requiring physical hardware.

## Functional Goal

The primary objective of this project is to develop the firmware and an intuitive control application for the robotic arm, offering the following features:

- **Adaptability**: Seamless support for robotic arms of varying sizes and configurations.
- **Programming Options**:
    - Block-based programming for beginners.
    - Text-based coding for experienced users.
    - Manual control using a controller.
- **Simulation Mode**: A virtual environment for task programming and previewing without the physical arm.
